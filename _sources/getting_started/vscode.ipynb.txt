    "If you are more familiar with jupyter notebooks, you may wish to explore running them on your laptop (instead of in Jupyter Open). VSCode is a code editor, which many people find helps them code better, debug faster, and keep good coding practices. Some of the strengths of VSCode for editing notebooks include its real editor powers: spellchecking and multiple corrections. We will not go through VSCode in much detail in this course, but here are some resources if you are interested, and you are welcome to ask us: \n",
