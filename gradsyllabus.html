<h2>Prerequisites<a class="headerlink" href="#prerequisites" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The course assumes a mathematics background including vector calculus, linear algebra
and partial differential equations. Students weak in either of these areas will be
directed to readings to strengthen their knowledge. Programming
experience is greatly recommended.</p>
</section>
<section id="course-structure">
<h2>Course Structure<a class="headerlink" href="#course-structure" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>This course is not lecture based. The course is an interactive, computer
based laboratory course. The computer will lead you through the
laboratory (like a set of lab notes) and you will answer problems most
of which use the computer. The course consists of three parts. A set of
required interactive, computer based laboratory exercises, a choice of
elective laboratory exercises and a project. The project will be a
group project determined through consultation between the instructors, the students and their
supervisors.</p>
<p>During the meeting times, there will be group worksheets to delve
into the material, brief presentations to help with technical
matters, time to ask questions in a group format and also individually
and time to read and work on the laboratories.</p>
<p>You can use a web-browser to examine the course exercises. Point your
browser to:</p>

<li><p>Project 40% (group)</p></li>
<li><p>Project Oral Presentation 10% (group)</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>There will be 7 assigned exercise sets or ‘Laboratory Exercises’ based on the labs.
Note that these are not necessarily the same as the problems in the
lab and will generally be a much smaller set.  Laboratory exercises
can be worked with partners or alone. Each student must upload their
own solution in their own words.</p>
<p>The laboratory exercise sets are to be uploaded to the course CANVAS page.
Sometimes, rather than a large series of plots, you may wish to
include a summarizing table. If you do not understand the scope of a
problem, please ask. Help with the labs is
available 1) through piazza (see CANVAS) so you can contact your classmates
and ask them 2) during the weekly scheduled lab or 3) directly from the
instructors during the scheduled office hours (see canvas).</p>
<p>Laboratory exercises will be graded as ‘excellent’, ‘good’, ‘satisfactory’ or ‘unsatisfactory’.
Your grade on canvas will be given as:</p>
<p>1.0 = excellent</p>
<p>0.8 = good</p>
<p>0.6 = satisfactory</p>
<p>0 = unsatisfactory</p>
<p>Grades will be returned within a week of the submission deadline.
If you receive a grade of <a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">`</span></a>good’, ‘satisfactory’ or ‘unsatisfactory’ on your first submission,
you will be given an opportunity to resubmit the problems you got incorrect to try to improve
your grade.  Note however, initial grades of <a href="#id3"><span class="problematic" id="id4">`</span></a>unsatisfactory’ will not be increased to <a href="#id5"><span class="problematic" id="id6">`</span></a>excellent’.
To get a score of ‘excellent’ or <a href="#id7"><span class="problematic" id="id8">`</span></a>good’ on a resubmission, you must include a full explanation of
your understanding of why your initial answer was incorrect, and what misconception, or mistake,
you have corrected to get to your new answer. Resubmissions will be due exactly 2 weeks after
the original submission deadline. It is your responsibility to manage the timing of the
resubmission deadlines with the next laboratory exercise.</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>There will be a <a href="#id9"><span class="problematic" id="id10">``</span></a>grace space’’ policy allowing you</dt><dd><p>to miss one laboratory exercise. The grace space policy
is to accommodate illness, <a href="#id11"><span class="problematic" id="id12">``</span></a>away games’’ for
athletes, conferences etc.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Quizzes are done online, reflect the learning objectives of each lab
and are assigned to ensure you do the reading with enough depth to
participate fully in the class worksheets and have the background to
do the Laboratory Exercises.   There will be a “grace space” policy
allowing you to miss one quiz.</p>
<p>The in-class worksheets will be marked for a complete effort. There
will be a “grace space” policy allowing you to miss one class
worksheet. In-class worksheets
are done as a group and are to handed in (one worksheet only per
group) at the end of the worksheet time.</p>
<p><strong>The project will be done in groups of three to four. The project topic is to be chosen in consultation with your research supervisors and the instructors. The subject of these projects has to be ocean or atmosphere related unless the group has identified an outside supervisor who is willing to provide subject specific advice.  Students without ocean/atmosphere expertise can join a ocean/atmopsheric sciences group - it will be up to the group to figure out where and how they can best contribute to the project.</strong></p>
<p>Assignments, quizzes, mini-projects and the project are expected on
time. Late mini-projects and projects will be marked and then the mark will be multiplied by
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((0.95)^{\rm (number\ of\ days\ or\ part\ days\ late)}\)</span>.</p>

<section id="academic-integrity">
<h2>Academic Integrity<a class="headerlink" href="#academic-integrity" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>What is academic integrity?</strong></p>
<p>The academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and integrity. As members of this enterprise, all students are expected to know, understand, and follow the codes of conduct regarding academic integrity. At the most basic level, this means submitting only original work done by you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas and attributing them to others as required. This also means you should not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is your work; nor should you help others to do the same. For example, it is prohibited to: share your past assignments and answers with other students; work with other students on an assignment when an instructor has not expressly given permission; or spread information through word of mouth, social media, websites, or other channels that subverts the fair evaluation of a class exercise, or assessment.</p>
<p><strong>Why is academic integrity important?</strong></p>
<p>As a student, your number one task is to learn new things. Just like your professors, however, you are a member of a university scholarly community. As a part of this community, you are responsible for engaging with existing knowledge and contributing ideas of your own. Academics—including you!—build knowledge through rigorous research that expands on the contributions of others, both in the faraway past and around the world today. This is called scholarship. Academic integrity, in short, means being an honest, diligent, and responsible scholar. This includes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Accurately reporting the results of your research, e.g., when collecting data in a lab or running a computer simulation</p></li>
<li><p>Completing assignments independently or acknowledging collaboration when appropriate. Collaboration through group work is an effective way to learn. We will clearly indicate when you should collaborate, for example during in-class group work and on the projects.</p></li>
<li><p>Creating and expressing your own original ideas.</p></li>
<li><p>Engaging with the ideas of others, both past and present, in a variety of scholarly platforms such as research journals, books by academics, lectures, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Explicitly acknowledging the sources of your knowledge, especially through accurate citation practices.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Collaboration and Group Work</strong></p>
<p>Many course activities and some assignments are designed to be completed in groups, allowing you to work with your peers. Other assignments are individual, and you are expected to complete these by working individually and writing in your own words. It is unacceptable to have others write assignments on your behalf, to write assignments on others’ behalf, to copy other students’ work, or to allow other students to copy your work.</p>
<p><strong>What happens when academic integrity is breached?</strong></p>
<p>Violations of academic integrity (i.e., misconduct) includes any conduct by which a student gains or attempts to gain an unfair academic advantage or benefit thereby compromising the integrity of the academic process, or helping or attempting to help another person commit an act of academic misconduct or gain, or attempt to gain, an unfair academic advantage. Academic misconduct leads to the breakdown of the academic enterprise, and therefore serious consequences arise and harsh sanctions are imposed. For example, incidences of plagiarism or cheating may result in a mark of zero on the assignment and more serious consequences may apply if the matter is referred for consideration for academic discipline. Careful records are kept to monitor and prevent recurrences. Any instance of cheating or taking credit for someone else’s work, whether intentionally or unintentionally, can and often will result in at minimum a grade of zero for the assignment, and these cases will be reported to the Head of the Department of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences and Associate Dean Students of the Faculty of Science.</p>

<section id="sharing-course-materials">
<h2>Sharing Course Materials<a class="headerlink" href="#sharing-course-materials" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Labs themselves are available on a public website and as a github repository.  You are welcome to return to those web resources, or point your friends to them, at any time, now and into the future.  However, the materials posted on Canvas are for your use, during the course, only. We are working hard to provide all the materials you need to succeed in this course. In return, please respect our work. All assignment instructions, quiz questions and answers, discussion questions, announcements, PowerPoint slides, jupyter notebooks, audio/video recordings, Canvas modules, and any other materials provided to you by us on Canvas are for use in this course by students currently enrolled in EOSC 511 or ATSC 409. It is unacceptable to share any of these materials beyond our course, including by posting on file-sharing websites (e.g., CourseHero, Google Docs). It is unacceptable to copy and paste sentences from the course notes (e.g., definitions) into for-profit software (e.g., Quizlet) for use in studying. Respect our and previous instructors’ intellectual property, and follow copyright law.</p>

<section id="generative-artificial-intelligence-tools">
<h2>Generative Artificial Intelligence Tools<a class="headerlink" href="#generative-artificial-intelligence-tools" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The term “GenAI” refers to the following tools as well as any other similar models that create content using sophisticated learning algorithms: ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, Gemini, Llama, DeepSeek, and many translation tools. GenAI also refers to such tools that may be integrated into other services like Notion, Canva, and Grammarly.</p>
<p>Students are permitted to use artificial intelligence tools, including generative AI, to gather information, review concepts or to help produce projects or mini-projects. However, students are ultimately accountable for the work they submit, and any content generated or supported by an artificial intelligence tool must be cited appropriately.</p>
<section id="for-the-project-and-miniproject">
<h3>For the Project and Miniproject<a class="headerlink" href="#for-the-project-and-miniproject" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you use any GenAI tools at any stage of the project or mini-project – including for ideas, drafting, editing, or proofreading – you must declare your use. Add an extra page at the end of your submission explaining how you used GenAI, with enough detail for your instructor or TA to understand your contribution. Failure to fully disclose the use of GenAI is considered academic misconduct. Use the APA guidelines (<a class="reference external" href="https://guides.library.ubc.ca/GenAI/cite">https://guides.library.ubc.ca/GenAI/cite</a>) when citing genAI. Failure to properly cite the use of GenAI is considered academic misconduct.</p>
<p>GenAI and groups/teams: Group work is an important part of this course, however, it introduces additional challenges around GenAI use. Therefore, for the group project, the group must hold a discussion, with all members present, when beginning the work. During this discussion the group must agree on whether, how, and by whom GenAI tools will be used (to be documented in a shared file or email). All group members are expected to then communicate honestly with their group about their own use of GenAI. If it is determined that GenAI was used in a way that violates the assessment’s rules, the entire group may be held responsible.</p>

<p>GenAI is Discouraged. The labs and in-class worksheets are important learning opportunities. We do assign marks to encourage you to complete them, but they are not marked “hard’ and do not have many marks attached. We believe you will learn more, and get more practise on your computing skills, if you do not use GenAI.</p>
