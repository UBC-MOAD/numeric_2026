#
#   - We will be referring to Phil Austin's version of  David Pine's Introduction to Python:
#     http://phaustin.github.io/pyman.  The notebooks for each chapter are included
#     in the [numeric_students/pyman](https://github.com/phaustin/numeric_students/tree/downloads/pyman) folder.
#   - If you are new to python, I would recommend you also go over the
#     following short ebook in detail:
#       - Jake Vanderplas' [Whirlwind tour of
#         Python](https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython/blob/f40b435dea823ad5f094d48d158cc8b8f282e9d5/Index.ipynb)
#         is available both as a set of notebooks which you can clone from
#         github or as a free ebook:
#         <http://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/a-whirlwind-tour-of-python.csp>
#           - to get the notebooks do:
#             
#             git clone <https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython>
#   - We will be referencing chapters from:
#       - A Springer ebook from the UBC library: [Numerical
#         Python](https://login.ezproxy.library.ubc.ca/login?qurl=https%3a%2f%2flink.springer.com%2fopenurl%3fgenre%3dbook%26isbn%3d978-1-4842-0554-9)
#           - with code on github:
#             
#             git clone
#             <https://github.com/jrjohansson/numerical-python-book-code>
#   - Two other texts that are available as a set of notebooks you can
#     clone with git:
#       - <https://github.com/fangohr/introduction-to-python-for-computational-science-and-engineering>
#       - <https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook/blob/master/notebooks/Index.ipynb>
#   - My favorite O'Reilly book is:
#       - [Python for Data
#         Analysis](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023784.do)
#   - Some other resources:
#       - If you know Matlab, there is [Numpy for Maltab
#         users](http://wiki.scipy.org/NumPy_for_Matlab_Users)
#       - Here is a [python
#         translation](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/phaustin/1af744215e51562d010b9f6a19c0724c)
